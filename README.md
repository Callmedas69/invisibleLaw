# Invisible Law

*The Golden Ratio made visible.*

---

There exists a mathematical constant that governs the spiral of galaxies, the arrangement of petals, and the proportions we find beautiful without knowing why.

The ancient Greeks called it the *Divine Proportion*.

We call it **Phi**.

## The Invisible Law

Why do some compositions feel harmonious while others feel chaotic?

Why does the Parthenon please the eye?

Why do sunflowers spiral in that particular way?

The answer is **Phi** (Φ ≈ 1.618033...) — a ratio discovered by mathematicians but obeyed by nature long before humans existed.

It appears in:
- The spiral of nautilus shells
- The branching of trees
- The proportions of the human face
- The structure of galaxies

**Invisible Law** makes this hidden principle visible through generative art.

## 618 On-Chain Artworks

Each piece is constructed on a **9×9 Phi grid**, where every intersection point is positioned according to the golden ratio:

```
0% — 14.6% — 23.6% — 38.2% — 50% — 61.8% — 76.4% — 85.4% — 100%
```

These are not arbitrary numbers.

They are Phi and its powers — the same proportions used by Renaissance masters and modern architects alike.

The collection size — **618 pieces** — is itself a reference to Phi's decimal form (1.**618**).

## Bauhaus Mosaic

Each artwork is geometric abstraction in the tradition of Kandinsky and Mondrian, where form follows mathematical function.

Six layers build every piece:

1. **Phi Grid** — 9×9 structural lines at golden ratio positions
2. **Boundary Circle** — Central focus at radius 360
3. **Mosaic Rectangles** — Colored tiles that breathe and pulse
4. **Intersection Dots** — Fibonacci-sized markers at grid points
5. **Concentric Rings** — Secondary focal points
6. **Extended Lines** — Connections reaching to the edges

Eight carefully chosen colors create harmony:

| Warm | Cool | Anchor |
|------|------|--------|
| Coral Red | Teal | Cream |
| Golden Yellow | Sage Green | Near Black |
| Burnt Orange | Blue | |

## Rarity & Meaning

Rarity in **Invisible Law** is not random. Each tier represents a philosophical state.

| Tier | Chance | Essence |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Legendary** | 2% | Spiral, Unity, Zero — transcendent states |
| **Rare** | 8% | Sequence, Infinite, Ratio — mathematical concepts |
| **Uncommon** | 20% | Enhanced — elevated density |
| **Standard** | 70% | Standard — balanced harmony |

---

## On-Chain Forever

**Invisible Law** exists entirely on-chain.

No IPFS. No external servers. No dependencies.

Each artwork is generated as pure SVG at the moment you view it, computed from a seed stored at mint time.

As long as the blockchain exists, your art exists — exactly as it was meant to be, governed by the same invisible law that shapes the universe.

**Your seed. Your art. Forever.**
